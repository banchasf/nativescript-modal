# Modal completion issue

When we close a modal, the result is return to the caller however the modal is not closed completely and causes the unexpected navigation.
We can use the setTimeout to wait until the modal is closed completely and proceed to other activity.
Would like to get suggestion how to handle modal closing without waiting or delay.
